Midsommar<br>
1/21/20
</p>
<p>
I don’t think people got Midsommar very right. When I say people, I mean “I
don't think that people who explain things like Midsommar got ‘it’ right when
they explained Midsommar”, which is to say “it” being “the movie.” And also to
say that “people” is “the people who explain things.” Henceforth referenced as
“the explainers.”
</p>
<p>
I’ll say this much: I watch a lot of explainer videos. I’ve had all sorts of
people explain all sorts of things, to me. I’ve had things explained <em>at</em>
me even. I’ll say this much again. I was born from a cocoon spun from the fibers
plucked meticulously out of the baby food which was fed to me by way of
airplane, or train depending on which mode of transportation my parents had
selected to metaphorically and also literally “feed” me. I am a product of
products probably, someone likely had to explain the mechanics of existence
before I could be fully formed. I love grasping at straws, but mostly, I love
grasping at spoons with which to be fed.
</p>
<p>
My early days of spoon grasping would consist of the typical misantropic veneer
of acquiring certain trivialized pieces of intelligentsia, say for instance I
could be like “so uhhh have you read <em>The Sound and The Fury</em>? No? Well
I’d say that <em>Transformers</em> is actually pretty Faulkner-esque.” That was
at the same time I was reading <em>Frog and Toad are Friends</em>. To children.
Who were five years old. At a Barnes and Noble. They did not care about Faulker.
I haven’t even read Faulker, I skimmed the Wikipedia page six years ago. And for
what it’s worth I think Frog and Toad have a relationship that is too loving to
be reduced to simply “friends.” And these five year olds deserved more.
</p>
<p>
And so do we.
</p>
<p>
After seeing <em>Midsommar</em>, which I saw after seeing <em>Hereditary</em>
the year before, which I saw after seeing <em>Drive</em> three years before on
my family’s Roku that only supports 720p resolution, I was hungry. Hungry as I
had been hungry before. MIDSOMMAR ENDING EXPLAINED, I said with my keyboard.
What I saw was more like “DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN.” Because it was wrong. The
videos declared triumph, the articles declared triumph. Triumph on behalf of
Dani. Triumph on behalf of the new community that has accepted her. Triumph over
the evils of an unsympathetic, emotionally abusive boyfriend and the acceptance
of Dani by a new family who can help her through the pain of loss.
</p>
<p>
What.
</p>
<p>
Do…. do I need to see the movie again? Do I need to see the movie again? You
know, I almost saw the director’s cut but it was playing at a theater too far
away from me at a time too inconvenient and so I looked up the changes that the
director’s cut had to offer. More scenes of Christain being an ass of a
boyfriend. For the record, he is an ass of a boyfriend. The birthday cake thing
was a laugh and a half, and not in the good way.
</p>
<p>
But I have to wonder if the authors of these articles and videos really saw the
cult as a serious place of empathy and comfort for Dani, because I thought that
what they did to her (and what is implied will keep happening to her for the
rest of her life as an existing occupant of the film’s continued universe) is a
twisted homunculean-esque blob barely resembling empathy. The emotional abuse
doled out by Pelle and the rest of the gang (basically bloomer wojack gone
wrong, isn’t that sort of the movie’s aesthetic?) is so much worse.
</p>
<p>
I am not qualified to talk about the signs, effects, or mechanics of emotional
abuse. This is a serious topic that should be handled delicately by a trained
professional or by someone with greater emotional intelligence than me. But I
will maintain that I am about to discuss the topic in a manner NO LESS COURTEOUS
than those who choose to explain the movie to me in a way that so blatantly
disregards the logistics of communication.
</p>
<p>
So with my admittance of noviceness out of the way, let’s get into the Meat and
Potatoes. Be ready to enhance that image, zoom in, etc. etc. (thank you Ari
Aster for your attention to detail regarding runes but I do think you
overestimated the ability of the “explainers” to get right the emotional core of
the film).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Number One:</strong> Saying that “you know how that feels” is not how
you comfort someone. Say for the sake of this exercise you’ve been feeling your
relationship with your significant other becoming more distant. Say for the sake
of this exercise you’ve come home to witness a brutal murder-suicide of your
entire nuclear family unit. Say your name is Dani. In the emotional wake of this
life changing event that will require a lifetime of therapy and support in order
to overcome you experience an overwhelming moment and begin to cry. Now I’d like
to ask all of my EXPLAINERS which of the following choices seems to be the most
empathetic: 1) Saying “it’s okay I know <strong>exactly</strong> how you feel, I
lost my parents too” or 2) literally anything else. Spoiler warning: it’s #2. So
when Pelle sits down to comfort Dani as he does THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE to say
“awww it’s alright I also lost my parents so you don’t need to worry” it is
actually Bad. It can also be surmised that Pelle lost his parents to the ritual
rebirth that happens when the old people get to be 72 but that’s not even
important, just makes him that much worse.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Number Two:</strong> I want to talk about Christian for a second.
Christian is not a good boyfriend. Christian is not a good friend. Christian is
greedy, shallow, and uhhh something else bad. He’s not good, and I’m not saying
he is good. What I am saying is that there are parts of his behavior that AS A
CHARACTER IN A MOVIE I don’t really blame him for. I don’t think there’s enough
discussion on the tragedy that he suffers as well, albeit a miniscule tragedy in
comparison to Dani’s. But imagine for just a moment that a young couple,
drifting apart, growing more emotionally distant, and suddenly something
catastrophic happens. Clearly Dani needed emotional support. But is Christian
really the one that people should expect would be providing that emotional
support? He was a bad boyfriend before the freaking murder-suicide. He was not
capable of being someone who could provide the care, attention, and love to Dani
in the way that she needed. In the end, the fact that they were still together
doomed them both because Dani was looking for support in Christian and Christian
literally could not provide that support, being the garbage man that he was. And
he was garbage! Garbage through and through. Garbage for cheating on Dani.
Garbage for abandoning Dani. Garbage for not listening to Dani. But I still
don’t think that his behaviour constitutes the celebration of his brains being
melted from the inside as his fleshy-person-prison is engulfed in a vengeful
flame.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Number Three:</strong> What kind of a community is this, bro? I am lucky
enough to have some really, really good friends. I know I cannot speak for
everyone when I say: hey, when I’m sobbing, I am not comforted by everyone else
sobbing! But this is how I feel. This is not a good way to comfort someone! I
mean, maybe as some sort of cathartic exercise that supplements a session of
active listening over maybe a nice glass of lemonade and a box of tissues. But
certainly not as the main course, if comforting is to be seen as a meal
(“comfort food”, anyone?). When I saw Dani’s cries being swallowed by the sounds
of the women around her, I saw robbery. This was her sincere expression of
despair, as a result of a situation specifically crafted by the people of the
community (I am not convinced that she discovered Christain cheating by
accident), so for the cult folks (the gang) to then posture as a source of
safety is theft. Dani never has the chance to express her emotions in a way that
is individual. Her suffering is always contextualized as “one of many similar
experiences that everyone goes through and we’re all in this together” which
like no it’s not. At all. So when the explainers say that Dani has finally found
a new family slash new home slash whatever and they fail to mention that this
family is evil, manipulative and abusive, I think they miss a major point of the
story.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Number Four (the last number):</strong> THE SMILE. Yes, the smile. I’ll
be honest, the thing I wanted spoonfed to me most was the smile. Just tell me,
movie explainers, why would Dani smile as the last person she had anything
resembling a close relationship with goes up in flames? Let’s see. Vox says:
“For Dani, though, the purging is complete. She is spent. And Christian is going
up in flames before her eyes. As she watches, she realizes that he is gone. She
is free. She smiles.
Dani — an orphan — finally has a family.” I couldn’t disagree more, and this is
what has stuck with me most about this movie. That smile is not a happy smile.
Just like Dani was robbed in the wooden bunkhouse of her cathartic bawl, she is
robbed here too. She starts to sob, looks around at everyone else sobbing, and
suddenly the sincere expression of terror and loss becomes subsumed in the
pulsing, disgusting mass of flesh sacks in white robes spilling crocodile tears
and she has no choice but to smile, because to cry would be to become swallowed
and ultimately forgotten completely. The smile is the bird landing on the
Pequod’s mast as it swirls down into the sea. The smile is out of necessity, the
fight or flight instinct that guides our survival tactics. It’s the only thing
she has left, before the next crop of unsuspecting victims are brought into the
camp for the same ritual of systematic emotional (and physical) destruction, and
she is forced to repeat the cycle as a new part of the whole.
</p>
<p>
To me, this is the ultimate tragedy of <em>Midsommar</em>. Dani has everything
taken away from her, one by one, and when nothing is left she is forced to smile
because not smiling means losing the last thing she has left: the barrier that
keeps her form separate from the sea of… LCL…. fluid? Stay tuned for some
discussion of <em>Midsommar</em> and <em>Evangelion</em> sometime in the near or
distant future.
</p>
<p>
Dani was robbed, but I think in equal part the audience was robbed. Not by this
amazing film, but by a sea of content creators who did a very shallow reading of
a very rich and fruitful text and in turn spoiled what was potentially an
interesting, engaging, and necessary discourse on companionship in the face of
tragedy. Instead we have to discuss that through the lens of “are you in the
right headspace” message templates and misappropriation of the phrase “emotional
labor.”
</p>
<p>
So, those are my thoughts on Midsommar. If anyone has a case for why Her Smile
(™) is actually a happy one please feel free to email me. Otherwise thank you
for reading and I’ll see you next time.
